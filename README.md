This project is an Arduino game console. The gaming console is powered by a joystick, including the button press on the joystick. The schematic above is made with TinkerCAD, with the potentiometer on the side being the joystick (TinkerCAD doesn't have joysticks).

The gaming console has four "games". The first is a drawing editor, with a cursor controlled by the joystick. The second is a game similar to the Chrome dinosaur game, with the "i"s being obstacles. The third is a maze game, where you have to make it to the bottom right corner. The last is a guessing game, where you have to guess a number in the least amount of tries possible, with the Arduino telling you if your guess is closer to the actual number than your previous guess.

To reset the gaming console, press the reset button on the Arduino.
